# House_Rental_Database_Project
In this project we designed a database to store the details of owners, tenants, previous tenants, agents and vacant houses information. This database is to provide vacant houses information to the tenants searching for houses to rent. Agents can act as mediators for tenants and agents.
The primary purpose of this House rental database system is to provide the to-let houses information which is given by the owners to the people who are looking houses for rent. And this data base also contains he information of the previous rent, costs and tenant's details
